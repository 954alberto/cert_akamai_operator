# Explanation of Key Components:

## Kubernetes Client:

We use the kube crate to interact with the Kubernetes API.
Informer allows us to watch resources such as Secret and trigger actions when the secret is applied or updated.

## Watching the Secret:

The Informer::run() function monitors changes to the Kubernetes resources (here, the Secret).
When a secret is applied or updated, the operator triggers handle_secret() to extract the certificate and other details.

## Handling the Certificate:

handle_secret() extracts the certificate (tls.crt), private key (tls.key), and the certificate chain (tls.ca.crt) from the Kubernetes Secret.
Then it calls push_to_akamai() to upload these details to Akamai using their API.

## Pushing to Akamai:

We use the reqwest crate to send an HTTP POST request to Akamai’s API, uploading the certificate details in base64 encoding.

## Async Runtime:

Rust’s async ecosystem (using tokio here) is used to manage asynchronous operations efficiently. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks like interacting with the Kubernetes API and making HTTP requests to Akamai.

## Run the Operator

After you write the operator, you can run it locally or build a Docker image to deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.

To build the Rust operator:

```bash
cargo build --release
```
You can then deploy the operator to your Kubernetes cluster using a Deployment manifest. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cert-akamai-operator
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cert-akamai-operator
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cert-akamai-operator
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cert-akamai-operator
        image: your-docker-image
        imagePullPolicy: Always
```
5. Deploying to Kubernetes
After building the image and pushing it to your container registry, you can create a Kubernetes Deployment to deploy your operator.

## Conclusion:
This Rust-based operator listens for changes in Kubernetes Secret resources that Cert-Manager manages, extracts the certificate data, and pushes it to Akamai using their API. This approach leverages Kubernetes’ async processing with Rust's high-performance capabilities.
